# DataMunging
Data Munging with Python and R.
Data Scientis spend more than 70 to 80% of their time understading and getting the data in the shape required for algorithms.
In this gist I will use various tools available in both R and Python for massaging the data. I will start with R and try to replicate the same with Python once I reach a meaningful stop.
